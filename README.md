## What is this?
A basic recipe site that will link to several other kinds of food.
As you can see, i am interested in the carnivore diet :D

## What did I learn creating this?

I learned:
+ how the boilerplate works
+ how to structure a website in it's simplest form
+ that there is different ways to eat good and NOT have a seizure or a crash or end up a typical pre-diabetic office worker
